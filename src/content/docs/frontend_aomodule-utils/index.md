ao_module provide a list of utilities function which you can use to make developing WebApps easier.

## Usage

To use the utilities functions, your fist need to import the ao_module wrapper as follows.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="../script/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="../script/ao_module.js"></script>
```

And call them with the static class name ```ao_module_utils```. For example,

```js
let newUUID = ao_module_utils.getRandomUID(); //Return a random UUID from timestamp
```



## Objects Encoding

### objectToAttr(object)

Convert objects into a DOM attribute safe string

### attrToObject(attr)

Convert the DOM attribute string back to a JavaScript object

### stringToBlob(text, mimetype="text/plain") 

Convert string to blob object

### blobToFile(blob, filename, mimetype="text/plain")

Convert blob to File object. 



## File Utilities

### readFileFromFileObject(fileObject, successCallback, failedCallback=undefined) 

Read file object as text. Success callback will return the content of the file as string, while failed callback will return the reader error DOMException.

### getDropFileInfo(dropEvent)

Get the drop file properties ```{filepath: file_virtual_path, filename: file_name}``` from file drop events from File Manager. Return ```null``` if this is not a drop event from File Manager 

### getIconFromExt(ext)

Return Semantic UI supported icon class name (without the icon class) as string from given file extension. For example

```js
let fileExt = "pdf";
let iconElement = `<i class="${ao_module_utils.getIconFromExt(fileExt)} icon"></i>`;

### getWebSocketEndpoint()

Here is an example if the user is connecting in via HTTP from LAN.

```
ws://192.168.1.100:8080
```

And here is another example user is connecting into your server via HTTPS domain

```
wss://example.com
```

You can add your scripts relative path to it and create a websocket connection. Here is an example.

```js
let wsurl = ao_module_utils.getWebSocketEndpoint() + "/MyModule/backend/connect.agi";
```
